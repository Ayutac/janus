h1. Janus Multiagent Platform

Janus is a multi-agent platform fully implemented in Java 1.6. Janus enables developers to quickly create web, enterprise and desktop multiagent-based applications. It provides a comprehensive set of features to develop, run, display and monitor multiagent-based applications. Janus-based applications can be distributed across a network. Janus could be used as an agent-oriented platform, an organizational platform, and/or an holonic platform. Indeed Janus is built upon the "CRIO organizational metamodel":http://www.aspecs.org/CRIO in which the concepts of role and organization are first-class entities. It also natively manages the concept of recursive agents and holon.

Janus is free for non-commercial use and distributed under the terms of the "GPLv3.":http://www.janus-project.org/Licensing:Janus

Janus is jointly developed by the multiagent teams of the "Laboratoire Systèmes et Transports":http://www.multiagent.fr and the "Centro de Investigación de Tecnologías Avanzadas de Tucumán.":http://citat.org.ar
